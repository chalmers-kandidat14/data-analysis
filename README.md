data-analysis
=============
The Similarity.m can analyze the data poduced from a 'pfolder large' run (see pfolder README). If you put the folder 'chains' in the current directory of matlab the code should work except for the cell importing graphs. This cell is not needed by the rest of the code though.

Concepts worth looking into to understand code is:
Hierarchical cluster analysis
Multidimentional scaling
